# Lab 2b

## Objectives:

In this lab, you will learn how to do the following:

- Use Java to calculate simple math
- Store values entered from the user into variables
- Use Integer.parseInt(String) to convert a user input String into an integer.
- Assign the variables with the right data type
- Output a string to the screen

## Program: Calculating Area:
In this lab, you will write a program that asks the user for:
- The width of a square
- The width of a rectangle
- The height of a rectangle

Use the following **String** variable to store the values entered by the user.  You can use this same variable for all three inputs from the user.
- String answer;

Use the following three **int** variables to store the values entered by the user that have been converted to ints using **Integer parseInt(input):**
- int sqWidth;
- int recWidth;
- int recWidth;

Calculate the **areas** of each shape and store the values in the following variables:
- sqArea;
- recArea;

Output the dimensions and areas of each shape as shown in the Example Run.

Formulas:
- **Square**: Remember that since all sides of a square are the same length, the area of a square is any of its sides multiplied by itself.
- **Rectangle**: The area for a rectangle is width * height.

## Key program requirements:

- Use the Scanner to input Strings from the console using in.nextLine();
- Convert the Strings entered by the user to ints using Integer.parseInt(String)
- You must use five variables as described above
- Output must look exactly like the example run






## Example Run:

Please enter the width of the square: 5
Please enter width of the rectangle: 4
Please enter height of the rectangle: 10
The area of a square with a width of 5 is 25.
The area of a rectangle with a width of 4 and a height of 10 is 40.
